\title{Tabulate the number of cases where the pathogen(s) are detected in TAC
  results in the context of all cases by site and by age}
\usage{

  d,
  condition,
  pathogen,
  sites = NULL,
  specimen_types = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A data object obtained from \code{\link{load_data}}.}

\item{condition}{A string specifying the condition to tabulate causal chain
presence for. To list all possibilities, see \code{\link{valid_conditions}}.}

\item{pathogen}{A string specifying the pathogen to count positive cases of
in the TAC results.}

\item{sites}{An optional vector of site names to include in the tabulation.
If not provided, all sites will be used. See \code{\link{valid_sites}}.}

\item{specimen_types}{An optional vector of specimen types to include in the
calculation. If not provided, all specimen types will be used. See
\code{\link{valid_specimen_types}}.}
