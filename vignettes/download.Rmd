The CHAMPS (Child Health and Mortality Preventions Surveillance) website[^1] provides access to varying levels of detail of the collected data[^2]. Only the de-identified (L2) data that can be downloaded after you [register and request the data](https://champs.emory.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=PCEERX993Y)[^3] from Emory University will work with this package.

You will need to complete the survey to create an account that requires a mobile number and an email address. After completing the registration survey, the website will redirect you to a log in survey. Upon logging in, you will see the CHAMPS Data Access Request Form.

You want to select _'CHAMPS De-identified Data Set'_ and then submit that form.

On the following page, you will need to state your purpose for requesting the data and provide a digital signature to the Data Transfer Agreement. After signing the agreement, you can then click submit at the bottom of the page. Immediately after submitting, you will get two emails from data@champshealth.org.
